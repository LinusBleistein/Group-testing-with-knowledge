# Group Testing with Features

Repository for my project for the class Mathematics for Datascience (ENS Ulm, Master MVA, Gabriel Peyr√©). See the companion pdf file for details. 

This projection containts an implementation of some decoding algorithms used in group testing (see [this article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6781038)), contained in the file `reconstruction_alg.py`. The file `utils.py` contains some useful utility functions for creating CTPI and Bernoulli tests. Feel free to use the decoding algorithms (but beware, the code is really slow).
