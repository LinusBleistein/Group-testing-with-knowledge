For the part on reconstruction algorithms

- Plot different metrics for varying p parameter.
- Plot success probability, as defined in the papers, for different settings + eventually succes proba with small errors
- Plot F-score rather than precision / recall, since it applies for all algorithms. 
- Consider sparse case, dense case.
- Consider different randomizations for tests: Bernouilli design, constant tests per item. 
- Consider different sparsity regimes. 

For the first toy example

- Redo all tests with the correct metrics (success proba + success proba with small errors)
- Second toy example (KNN) really necessary ? Focus maybe on high dimensions ? 

Adding noise

- If possible, try some stuff in the noisy case
