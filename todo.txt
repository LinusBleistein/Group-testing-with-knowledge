- Plot different metrics for varying number of tests.
- Plot different metrics for varying p parameter. 
- Consider sparse case, dense case.
- Consider different randomizations for tests: Bernouilli design, constant tests per item. 
- Consider different sparsity regimes. 

- Simple case for a linear causal model.
- Find real data to use on.
- Combination w. sparsity for real data ? Sparse neural network ? Does something like this exist, or is it automatic ? Add a sparsity constraint in the loss ? :
